# PhotoAlbum (Work in Progress)

To run this program open in visual studio 2022 and press CTRL-F5 (Option-CMD-Enter on mac) to run.

Note: Visual studio may limit the console output. To see full output you will need to go into the bin folder and run the program from there. The photo album in it's current state is a rough first version aimed to meet minimum requirements, improvements to come!
